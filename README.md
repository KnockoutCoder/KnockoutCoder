## .me

{ so... i’m an aspiring **product-minded full-stack developer** who started on the other side of the ticket queue - writing docs, filing bugs, and convincing engineers to “just add a quick filter.” ◡̈

when I wasn’t doing that, I was leading back-to-back client meetings - training teams, running adoption audits, and pretending my Wi-Fi could handle one more Loom recording.

<p align="center">
  <img src="officeladysmiling.gif" alt="KC working somehow" width="30%">
</p>

now I'm becoming that engineer I used to chase in Slack - still googling half my fixes, building the very features I used to beg for in JIRA comments, but at least it’s my own code now. 𐔌՞. .՞𐦯  and I'm finally living the life of the engineer on the other side of the ticket, whose reply takes a few deploys, a rollback, and emotional recovery time.

after years helping SaaS teams and marketplaces ship big, messy launches, I swapped onboarding checklists, delivery decks, and QBR meetings for code reviews - helping build the very platforms I once helped businesses grow on.

i like to think of my work as somewhere between product empathy and disciplined engineering - building tools that respect both the roadmap and the humans behind it, because the best systems scale only when the people using them do too.

and just to put it out there - I’m a big fan of the DRY principle. Not just in code, but also in meetings, documentation, and life in general. ◡̈

### 1. AI-powered color & face shape analyzer  
a web app that figures out your **face shape**, **skin undertone**, and **color season** - then pairs it with **fashion and makeup recommendations** that actually make sense.  
> your “AI-powered personal stylist,” but with less judgment and faster response time.

#### ✦ built with--  
- **frontend:** HTML5 · CSS3 · Vanilla JavaScript  
  > mobile-first, responsive, and optimized with the **Canvas API** for real-time image compression and rendering  
- **AI engine:** **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** - handles image understanding, facial geometry, color theory, and text generation *in one shot*  
- **content Layer:** **Pexels API** - for fetching contextual, high-quality fashion inspiration (no more mannequins from Unsplash 😅)  
- **networking & Logic:** Fetch API · Asynchronous orchestration with proper error handling and defensive coding  
- **performance Optimizations:**  
  - Image compression (≈90% smaller) via `canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.2)`  
  - Cached DOM references for buttery-smooth UI  
  - Smart fallback logic for API rate limits and JSON repair  

#### ✦ highlights--  
- reduced API cost by **85%** and response time by **60%** after migrating to Gemini 2.5 Flash:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- one unified multimodal request handles facial recognition, color analysis, and recommendation generation  
- defensive error handling for markdown wrappers, token truncation, and service downtime - because AI APIs *will* misbehave  
- progressive loading: main analysis first, fashion images stream in later for that “Netflix loading bar” feel  

🧩 *brings together everything I love - data, design, and human-centered technology.
also, it finally justifies the hours I’ve spent color-matching code editors to my desktop wallpaper.*

### 2. (coming soon)
