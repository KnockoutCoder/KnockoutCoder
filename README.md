## .me

i started on the other side of the ticket queue - leading back-to-back client meetings, training teams, running adoption audits, and pretending my Wi-Fi could handle one more Loom recording. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="officeladysmiling.gif" alt="KC working somehow" width="30%">
</p>

after years helping SaaS teams and marketplaces ship big, messy launches, I swapped onboarding checklists, delivery decks, and QBR meetings for designing, refactoring, and re-imagining systems - helping build the very platforms I once helped businesses grow on.

now that I've become the engineer I used to chase in Slack, i care about the small, intentional choices that make products feel human - the kind that turn predictability into confidence and usability into trust.

working with business users - from small teams to large-scale enterprises - has taught me how small decisions ripple: how a setting’s behavior can shape business logic, how a page’s load time can affect trust, and how missing guidance can quietly slow someone’s day. 

over time, I’ve seen how these moments - good or bad - compound into something larger: the kind of experience that earns **renewal**, or the kind that quietly drives **churn**.

the harsh reality is that most users never see the complexity of systems at scale - or the effort it takes to keep them from crashing - but they **FEEL** when a product cares about helping them reduce overhead, drive sales, or simply win a few hours back in their day.
<br></br>
**i build with that in mind**. 
<br></br>
my focus is on systems that are calm under pressure, transparent in behavior, and kind to those who rely on them. i like when design and engineering meet halfway - when a schema, a test, or a log line reflects thoughtfulness, not just functionality.

my background in customer success and delivery keeps me grounded in outcomes. 

it has given me a front-row view of how differently organizations think and reminds me that the _good engineering is quiet confidence - seen not in how much it does, but in how well it **endures**._

### 1. AI-powered color & face shape analyzer  
a web app that figures out your **face shape**, **skin undertone**, and **color season** - then pairs it with **fashion and makeup recommendations** that actually make sense.  
> your “AI-powered personal stylist,” but with less judgment and faster response time.

#### ✦ built with--  
- **frontend:** HTML5 · CSS3 · Vanilla JavaScript  
  > mobile-first, responsive, and optimized with the **Canvas API** for real-time image compression and rendering  
- **AI engine:** **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** - handles image understanding, facial geometry, color theory, and text generation *in one shot*  
- **content Layer:** **Pexels API** - for fetching contextual, high-quality fashion inspiration (no more mannequins from Unsplash 😅)  
- **networking & Logic:** Fetch API · Asynchronous orchestration with proper error handling and defensive coding  
- **performance Optimizations:**  
  - Image compression (≈90% smaller) via `canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.2)`  
  - Cached DOM references for buttery-smooth UI  
  - Smart fallback logic for API rate limits and JSON repair  

#### ✦ highlights--  
- reduced API cost by **85%** and response time by **60%** after migrating to Gemini 2.5 Flash:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- one unified multimodal request handles facial recognition, color analysis, and recommendation generation  
- defensive error handling for markdown wrappers, token truncation, and service downtime - because AI APIs *will* misbehave  
- progressive loading: main analysis first, fashion images stream in later for that “Netflix loading bar” feel  

🧩 *brings together everything I love - data, design, and human-centered technology.
also, it finally justifies the hours I’ve spent color-matching code editors to my desktop wallpaper.*

### 2. (coming soon)
